+ set HAVE_XMMSV automatically
	at the moment HAVE_XMMSV must be defined manually. The automatic detection
	could rely on XMMS_IPC_PROTOCOL_VERSION >= 13, as soon as it is bumped
	because of rv-split

+ check serialisations of lists, dicts, colls
	afaik dicts can now also contain dicts, make sure the deserialisation
	can handle that

+ rewrite propdict, perhaps into some QDict <QString, QDict<QString,QValue> >
  subtype

+ decode 'url' field in propdict
