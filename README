This is native Qt4 bindings for XMMS2.

************************************************************

DISCLAIMER! These bindings are not a official part of the
XMMS2 project and doesn't use the underlying libxmmsclient
library that all other bindings use. This means that this
code might lag a couple of versions after the official
project.

We have chosen to do this natively because of portability
and the fact that the official C++ bindings depend on boost.

If you are writing a Qt4 client, think hard and good about
using the official C++ bindings before going for these ones.

IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THESE BINDINGS, PLEASE CONTACT
THE PEOPLE IN THE AUTHORS FILE, NOT XMMS2 DIRECTLY.

************************************************************

Requirements:

These bindings has only been tested with HEAD of xmms2-devel
as of 2008-03-11. It might work with other version of XMMS2,
please report if you try it out.

You'll need a new version of Qt 4, we have tried it with Qt4.4
snapshots and Qt4.3.

These bindings doesn't depend on libxmmsclient to be compiled
but they will need the xmmsc/xmmsc_idnumbers.h header file to
get the IPC definitions. If you have libxmmsclient installed
qmake will try to use pkg-config to find the header, otherwise
you could copy it somewhere where it will find it.
